# HackerRank Practises

This repository contains solutions for various HackerRank coding challenges completed as part of Week 1 practice. The solutions are implemented in C#.

## Challenges Overview

Each challenge is implemented in a separate `.cs` file. Below is a brief description of each challenge along with its functionality.

### 1. **Diagonal Difference** (`DiagonalDifference.cs`)
   - Computes the absolute difference between the sums of the diagonals of a square matrix.

### 2. **Flipping Bits** (`FlippingBits.cs`)
   - Given a 32-bit unsigned integer, inverts all bits and returns the result.

### 3. **Lonely Integer** (`LonelyInteger.cs`)
   - Finds the unique integer in an array where all other elements appear twice.

### 4. **Mini-Max Sum** (`MiniMaxSum.cs`)
   - Given an array of five integers, finds the minimum and maximum sum of four out of the five numbers.

### 5. **Pangrams** (`Pangrams.cs`)
   - Determines whether a given string contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once.
     
### 6. **Permuting Two Arrays** (`PermutingTwoArrays.cs`)
   - Given two arrays and an integer `k`, checks whether they can be rearranged such that the sum of corresponding elements in both arrays is at least `k`.

### 7. **Plus Minus** (`PlusMinus.cs`)
   - Calculates and prints the proportions of positive, negative, and zero elements in an array.
     
### 8. **Sparse Arrays** (`SparseArrays.cs`)
   - Implements a frequency query system where the number of occurrences of given queries in an array is returned.

### 9. **Subarray Division** (`SubarrayDivision1.cs`)
   - Determines the number of contiguous subarrays of a given length that sum up to a target value.
     
### 10. **Time Conversion** (`TimeConversion.cs`)
   - Converts a 12-hour AM/PM time format into a 24-hour format.
