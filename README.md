# HackerRank Practises

This repository contains solutions for various HackerRank coding challenges completed as part of Week 1 practice. The solutions are implemented in C#.

## Challenges Overview

Each challenge is implemented in a separate `.cs` file. Below is a brief description of each challenge along with its functionality.

### 1. **Diagonal Difference** (`DiagonalDifference.cs`)
   - Computes the absolute difference between the sums of the diagonals of a square matrix.

### 2. **Flipping Bits** (`FlippingBits.cs`)
   - Given a 32-bit unsigned integer, inverts all bits and returns the result.

### 3. **Lonely Integer** (`LonelyInteger.cs`)
   - Finds the unique integer in an array where all other elements appear twice.
